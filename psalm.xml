      @internal has two definitions according to phpdoc.org:

      "The @internal tag is used to denote that associated Structural Elements are elements internal to this application or library. It may also be used inside a long description to insert a piece of text that is only applicable for the developers of this software."

      psalm is using the former semantics while phpseclib is using the latter.
